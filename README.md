# Mac Development Ansible Playbook

Originally forked from Jeff Geerling's [Mac Development Ansible Playbook](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook)

This playbook installs and configures most of the software I use on my Mac for 
web and software development. Some things in macOS are slightly difficult to 
automate, so I still have some manual installation steps, but at least it's 
all documented here.

This is a work in progress, and is mostly a means for me to document my current 
Mac's setup. I'll be evolving this set of playbooks over time.
