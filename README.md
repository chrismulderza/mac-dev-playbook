# Mac Development Ansible Playbook

A fork of Jeff Geerling's [Mac Development Ansible Playbook](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook)

This playbook installs and configures most of the software I use on my Mac for web and software development. Some things in macOS are slightly difficult to automate, so I still have some manual installation steps, but at least it's all documented here.

This is a work in progress, and is mostly a means for me to document my current Mac's setup. I'll be evolving this set of playbooks over time.

## Installation

I've wrapped the playbook into an installation script available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrismulderza/dotfiles/master/bin/install.sh)
